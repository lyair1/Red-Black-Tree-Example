Red-Black-Tree-Example
======================

a red black tree implementaion using java

This is an example of how to implement a Red Black Tree using java and Eclipse.

This project is an assignment I got in Data Structure course during my first degree of computer science
in Tel Aviv University in Israel.


Feel free to use this with whatever you want.

I find it hard to find the speciphic info I was looking for while writing this code so I thought it might be helpful
for you.


Have Fun.
